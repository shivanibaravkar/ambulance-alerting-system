# Ambulance-Alerting-System
7th Semester College Project.

## Problem statement from Smart india Hackathon:
It is common sight at busy traffic junctions where ambulances struggling find a way to carry patients for treatment on golden hour. Employing Drones which can carry payloads of 100kg, min at designated high traffic circuits will help many patients

## Problem statement I need to work on:
Now a days ambulances are facing lot of trouble in the traffic. We need to make reach the ambulances to the hospital in thte required time. We need to help the patient reach the best hospital best on the symptoms and the doctor availability

## Concept/Solution:
To Create a platform for 1) Ambulance Driver, 2) People, 3) Traffic Police, 4) Hospital
  
### Ambulance Driver

- May also submit the previous health report or the summary of the patient condition
#### What the Application do?
- Application shows the best hospital to go fast and it need show based on the availability of the bed and the doctor in the hospitla
- It shows the number of signal in between and send the message to the traffic police to clear the traffic in those signals
- It need to send the information to the required hospital so they wait for the patient (and studying about the patient history(if they entered the patient history))
### People
#### What They do?
- Used it to find the near by hospital based on the patient suffering
- Inform the hospital, so the hospital can get ready to treate the patient
#### What the Application do?
- Application shows the best hospital to go fast and it need show based on the availability of the bed and the doctor in the hospital
- It need to send the information to the required hospital so they wait for the patient (and studying about the patient history(if they entered the patient history))
### Traffic Police
#### What They do?
- Need to clear the traffic in the ambulance travelling road to make ambulance reach the hospital early
- If the traffic is high traffic police need to send the traffic is high message to the ambulance drive so the ambulance drive choose the alternative road

- Send the high traffic details so that the ambulance can take the alternative path
### Hospital

#### Server:
Server may be the local server (to make it online we can use ngrok)
SQL to store the data
#### Admin:
MYSQL command to enter the records

### Technology:
- Python
- Flash frame work
